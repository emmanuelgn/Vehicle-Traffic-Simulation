# Vehicle-Traffic-Simulation

This project is a basic traffic simulation in a city, featuring cars, traffic lights, and roads. It currently includes a simple implementation where cars move along a road, with plans to expand functionality to include traffic lights and more complex interactions.

## Features

- **Car Movement**: Simulates the movement of cars with adjustable speed.
- **Project Structure**: Organized with separate directories for source and header files.
- **CMake Build System**: Easily compile and manage the project with CMake.

## How to Compile

To compile the project, ensure you have CMake and a C++ compiler installed. Then follow these steps:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

## How to Run

After compilation, run the program with:

```bash
./TrafficSimulation
```

## Future Enhancements
* Implement traffic lights to control car flow.
* Add multiple roads and intersections.
* Simulate more complex traffic patterns and interactions.

Feel free to expand the README with more detailed instructions or project descriptions as you develop additional features.
